Contact Information: This should be at the top of your CV and include your name, address, phone number, and email.\n\n2. Objective Statement: Include a brief statement about what you're looking for in a job.\n\n3. Work Experience: List your work experience in reverse chronological order. Include the name of the company, dates of employment, and a bullet list of your responsibilities and achievements.\n\n4. Education: Like work experience, this should be in reverse chronological order. Include the name of the institution, degree earned, and year of graduation.\n\n5. Skills: Highlight any relevant skills that pertain to the job you're applying for.\n\n6. References: You can either list them on your CV or state \"References available upon request.\"\n\nRemember to keep it concise, use action verbs, quantify achievements when possible (e.g., \"increased sales by 25%\"), and tailor it to each job application.\n\nIf you need more specific advice or help with formatting in a Word document or another platform, just let me know!"
